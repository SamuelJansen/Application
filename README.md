# Application
A desktop framework based on python.

Example: Chess game

## Projects directory

Put Application repository in the same directory of "your Chess project"

```
C:\Users\my_user\path\path\path\all_my_git_projects
```

<p align="center"><img alt="All projects directory" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b3/c8/a4/b3c8a41f5b74aa86ef05b99f33ab2c68.png" /></p>

Obs.: If needed, you can find mor information about Globals here: https://github.com/SamuelJansen/Globals

## Put PathMannanger.py in your "main" api

On Chess/api/src/ChessApplication.py (the main class that will consume Application library), 
you put the PathMannanger.py file following this path tree:

```
C:\Users\my_user\path\path\path\all_my_git_projects\Chess\api\src\domain\control\PathMannanger.py
```

Once again, "chess main class" needs to be in src directory.

<p align="center"><img alt="PathMannanger file in Chess/api/src/domain/control directory" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e6/62/cb/e662cb3f41fecba77572de839a5e7a9f.png" /></p>

## Put this code in "your ChessApplication.py" file (the main class of your api)

Put the following code right on top of ChessApplication class.

```
if __name__ == '__main__' :
    from domain.control import PathMannanger
    pathMannanger = PathMannanger.PathMannanger(printStatus = True)

    import Chess
    Chess.Chess(pathMannanger).run()
```

Notice the .run() method bein called in your main class. It's important.

<p align="center"><img alt="Chess api main file" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6b/32/ff/6b32ffba3ecc48c232a9d9543f38223b.png" /></p>

By doing so, whenever you run you api in command prompt, you should be able to see the pathMannanger import path tree like this:

<p align="center"><img alt="Chess api main file" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/37/c7/6a/37c76addfcc511a00daa7e4eecef7d9e.png" /></p>

From now on, classes paths wont be a problem anymore

## Now, extend Application on "your Chess.py" class

Applicaiton should be extendend into one of your classes. In this example, it's Chess.py

```
import Application

class Chess(Application.Application):

    def __init__(self,pathMannanger):

        Application.Application.__init__(self,pathMannanger,floor=True)
```

Be a cool kid. Only one class in your project can inherit from Application.

And the .run() method of this same class must be called in your main (see above)

<p align="center"><img alt="Chess domain class" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0f/ff/c4/0fffc4816db499719e0eee6005e576e5.png" /></p>

By setting floor to true, you automatically gain a "background image". All you have to do is put this "background image" in the correct directory with the correc name (see bellow)

This "background image" must be a png and be named like this: "YourApiName.floor.png"

In this example, it's "Chess.floor.png"

the directory follows:

```
the_whole_path_up_to_chess_project\Chess\api\src\resource\image\application floor\Chess.floor.png
```

<p align="center"><img alt="Chess.floor.png" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3b/cc/d1/3bccd1addb8d8ab64aa729d19dec9f63.png" /></p>

Of course there are flexible ways to set your background image. This is just a quick start

Once you do that, you should be able to run "ChessApplication.py" form your command prompt

On Windows

```
the_whole_path_up_to_chess_project\Chess\api\src>ChessApplication.py
```

On Mac

```
the_whole_path_up_to_chess_project\Chess\api\src>pyton3 ChessApplication.py
```

<p align="center"><img alt="ChessApplication.py" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/06/56/e90656587a8c955241397fd38f376a9a.png" /></p>

To quit, click on command prompt and hit `ctrl + c`

## How does Application library woks ‚ùì

Of course there won't be any chess game at all if run this so far. The game needs to be implemented.

Let's start whit an exit button

-----

# UserInterface 

"UserInterface" is a root from a bunch of Application classes

"Button" is one of its manny implementetions

## Make a Button

import Button and instantiate it. Done

In this exemple, it's instantiated in the Chess.py class

```
import Application, Button

class Chess(Application.Application):

    def __init__(self,pathMannanger):

        Application.Application.__init__(self,pathMannanger,floor=True)

        button_name = 'exitChessButton'
        button_position = [0,0]
        button_size = [40,40]

        button_father = self

        Button.Button(
            button_name,
            button_position,
            button_size,
            button_father,
            onLeftClick = exitChessButtonFunction
        )

def exitChessButtonFunction(event):

    application = event.application

    application.close(event)
```

<p align="center"><img alt="exitChessButton instance" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/40/90/9540901887de16874af3b300d706b51d.png" /></p>

As Button is a UserInterface implementation, its image stays on "user interface" directory. 

The image file name must be the same of the object name

```
the_whole_path_up_to_chess_project\Chess\api\src\resource\image\user interface\exitChessButton.png
```

Again. There are flexible ways to do so. This is just an "easy path"

<p align="center"><img alt="exitChessButton.png" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/19/3b/5c193b858fb7dd3c25c55eb92eece431.png" /></p>

‚òéÔ∏è ‚ùóÔ∏è ‚òéÔ∏è Some important things ‚òéÔ∏è ‚ùóÔ∏è ‚òéÔ∏è

- Every object must have a unique name. There are ways to make it under the hood but... it's often nice to know their names

- objects and styles are in the same file. It's part of their code

- every object have its father. If we ommit the father of one object, its father becomes the "floor" and it's not cool.

- there is no ".run()" method, except the one in your main class

- there is no state. Globals api (implemented in PathMannager class) takes care of it

## Events üåà

You might be wondering about the exit function itself

And yes. It's actualy that simple:

- Any function recieves an event as input.

- any event have the application on it

- the sky is not the limit üöÄ

<p align="center"><img alt="exitChessButton.png" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/46/1a/54/461a54b109c4910fe3f0f2df6d630258.png" /></p>

If you run ChessApplication.py, you should be able to see a big exit button on the left upper corner of your screen.

# The chalange.

Now, lets do something that's usualy a pain in the ass

`After clicking on the exit button, a modal must appears with a message and two buttons: an "ok" and a "cancel"`

It's usually time to cry, but just guive a look at the simplicity of it:

<p align="center"><img alt="exitChessButton.png" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ca/af/12/caaf128380d1dee1b29499e56af1b37f.png" /></p>

Done üòé 

And yes. The modal is actually implemented as a new page. 

No routes, no global states, nothing.

It's just that simple ‚ú®

```
import Message, ItemDto
import textFunction

messageName = 'exitChessMessageModal'

def exitChessButtonFunction(event):

    buttonPosition = ['fill','center']
    buttonSize = [85,45]
    messageFontSize = 18
    textPosition = ['center','padded']

    cancelButtonDto = ItemDto.ItemDto('cancel',
        position = buttonPosition,
        size = buttonSize,
        text = 'Cancel',
        textPosition = textPosition,
        onLeftClick = cancel
    )
    okButtonDto = ItemDto.ItemDto('ok',
        position = buttonPosition,
        size = buttonSize,
        text = 'Ok',
        textPosition = textPosition,
        onLeftClick = ok
    )

    messageButtonsDto = [cancelButtonDto,okButtonDto]
    message = 'Do you want to exit the game?'

    Message.Message(event.object,message,
        name = messageName,
        messageButtonsDto = messageButtonsDto,
        fontSize = messageFontSize
    )

def cancel(event) :
    message = event.application.findObjectByName(messageName)
    message.close()

def ok(event) :
    message = event.application.findObjectByName(messageName)
    message.close()

    application = event.application
    application.close(event)
```

And in your Chess.py class you import it and pass it as the "onLeftClick" Button method

```
import Application, Button, exitChessButtonFunction

class Chess(Application.Application):

    def __init__(self,pathMannanger):

        Application.Application.__init__(self,pathMannanger,floor=True)

        button_name = 'exitChessButton'
        button_position = [0,0]
        button_size = [40,40]

        button_father = self

        Button.Button(
            button_name,
            button_position,
            button_size,
            button_father,
            onLeftClick = exitChessButtonFunction.exitChessButtonFunction
        )
```

# The future üåç

I'll be implmenting more of this Chess example code on this other repository: https://github.com/SamuelJansen/Chess/tree/develop

Feel free to navigate throught the Application library source code here

Cheers
